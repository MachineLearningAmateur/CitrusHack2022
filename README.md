# Onsite

## Description

Onsite is an innovative check-in system made to maximize efficiency throughout the classroom. Onsite uses facial recognition software to effectively collect and utilize machine learning to identify different individuals based on their face structure. The software is provided images of a student's face, preferably from different angles, which then checks attendance from a live camera. This software would reduce unnecessary time wasted recording attendance and supply students with more time reviewing coursework.
